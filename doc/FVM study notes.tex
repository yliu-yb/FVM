\begin{itemize}
    \item Central differencing scheme
    \item Upwind differencing scheme is the most stable and unconditionally bounded scheme, 
but it introduces a high level of false diffusion due to its low order of accuracy (first-order).
    \item Hybrid differencing scheme.
    \item Quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinetics (QUICK) sch-eme (Leonard, 1979).
    \item Total variation diminishing (TVD) scheme. 
\end{itemize}

Higher-order schemes such as central differencing and QUICK can give spurious oscillations 
or 'wiggles' when the Peclet number is high. TVD scheme designed to address this undesirable 
oscillatory behavior of higher-order schemes. In TVD schemes the tendency towards oscillations
is counteracted by adding an artificial diffusion fragment or by adding a weighting towards 
upstream contribution.
